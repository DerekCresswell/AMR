# A Mathematical Rig

A Mathematical Rig (abbreviated AMR) is a tool for creating and working with complex mathematical topics in the C++ language.

**Note:** This is under active development.
No features are guaranteed to be in perfect working order until a stable `1.0.0` release is made.

## Introduction

AMR allows for easy manipulation and creation of mathematical ideas such as sets, equations, logic, and theorems.

### Example Usage

A full suite of examples can be found in the [Examples folder](./Examples) which you can read through and run yourself.

This is how you might use some of the most common features of AMR:

#### Sets and Ranges
